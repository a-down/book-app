# NextJS and React Native Book App

I am building a mobile and web application to keep track of books that the user has read. The primary goals are:

- view books read
- view statistics about recent reading history
- share books with friends
- view on mobile application or web client

## Tech Stack

This project is a Turbo Monorepo using Solito Navigation. I will use the same code for the React Native Expo Application and the Client-Side Rendering Pages on the website. NextJS will be used for the Server-Side Rendering Pages (landing, about, etc).

- NextJS
- React Native
- Nativewind (TailwindCSS for React Native)
- Turbo
- Solito

## Updates and Contact

I will update the README as my progress continues. Please reach out if you are curious about any aspect of the project!
